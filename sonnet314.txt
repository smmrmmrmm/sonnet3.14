A canvas of an empty list will do
the counter I then set to equal none,
for i in range one thousand-sixty-two.
	if i mod thirty equals twenty-one.
		if the counter lies twixt twelve and six
			the line is fourteen dots, twelve sharps, nine dots
		elif 'tween twenty and four less it sticks
			instead its sixteen sharps post nine-teen spots
		else thirty-five full stops the line's comprised
		the line becomes the line and line reversed
		the counter, adding one, is now resized
		the line appends the canvas uncoerced
row by row the canvas prints its part
print("Who said I can't make code into art")
